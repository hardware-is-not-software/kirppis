# Day 2 - Admin Page Improvements and Database Exploration

## What We Did Today

### 1. Fixed User Management in Admin Page

We identified and fixed several issues in the Admin Page component related to user management:

- Fixed the comparison logic for disabling role change and delete buttons for the current user
- Added a helper function `isCurrentUser()` to check if a user in the table is the same as the currently logged-in user
- Updated the User interface to include the `_id` property to fix linter errors
- Added validation to check for valid user IDs before attempting to delete a user or change a user's role
- Added error handling to display a message when no user ID is provided
- Improved the delete button and role change handler to use either `user._id` or `user.id` as the user ID

### 2. Server Port Configuration

We addressed port conflict issues:

- Initially changed the server port from 5000 to 5001 to avoid conflicts
- Updated the client API configuration to match the new server port
- Updated the CORS configuration to include the new port
- Later reverted back to port 5000 based on requirements

### 3. Database Exploration

We created a script to explore the MongoDB database:

- Created a script at `server/src/scripts/db-query.ts` to query the database
- Discovered the structure of collections: categories, items, users, and tests
- Identified the user data structure and how IDs are stored in MongoDB

### 4. Multiple Image Support

We implemented support for multiple images per item:

- Updated the `Item` interface to include an `imageUrls` array property
- Modified the `ItemFormPage` to support uploading multiple images
- Added a grid view to display all uploaded images with the ability to remove individual images
- Created a gallery view in the `ItemDetailPage` with navigation arrows and thumbnails
- Added an indicator in the `ItemsPage` to show when an item has multiple images

### 5. Currency Selection Feature

We added support for multiple currencies:

- Updated the `.env` file to include available currencies and a default currency
- Created a currency utility module with functions for formatting prices and handling currency symbols
- Updated the `Item` interface to include a currency field
- Modified the `ItemFormPage` to include a currency selection dropdown next to the price input
- Updated the item display in `ItemDetailPage` and `ItemsPage` to show prices with the correct currency symbol
- Implemented proper formatting for different currencies (e.g., JPY without decimal places, NOK with symbol after the amount)

### 6. Docker Documentation

We created comprehensive Docker documentation:

- Added a `DOCKER.md` file with instructions for running the application in Docker
- Included details on prerequisites, building and starting containers, and accessing the application
- Provided configuration information for environment variables
- Added troubleshooting tips for common issues
- Included guidance for development in Docker

### 7. Error Handling and UX Improvements

We enhanced error handling and user experience:

- Added robust error handling for image loading failures
- Implemented fallback mechanisms to ensure images always display properly
- Created a placeholder SVG image for when no image is available
- Added validation for required fields in forms
- Improved the UI with loading indicators and error messages

## How to Use What We Did

### Admin Page User Management

The Admin Page now correctly handles user management:

- Admins cannot change their own role or delete themselves
- The system properly identifies the current user using either ID or email
- Error handling prevents attempts to delete users with invalid IDs

### Database Query Script

To explore your MongoDB database:

1. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jonijantti/Documents/aiwork/kirppis && npx ts-node server/src/scripts/db-query.ts
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Connect to your MongoDB database
   - List all collections
   - Show sample documents from each collection
   - Display the total count of documents in each collection

This script is useful for debugging and understanding the current state of your database.

### Multiple Image Support

To use the multiple image feature:

1. When creating or editing an item, you can now select multiple images at once
2. You can also add more images to an existing item
3. The first image will be marked as the "Main" image and will be used as the primary display
4. You can remove individual images by hovering over them and clicking the "Ã—" button
5. On the item detail page, you can browse through all images using the navigation arrows or thumbnails
6. The image counter shows your current position in the gallery

### Currency Selection

To use the currency selection feature:

1. When creating or editing an item, you can now select a currency from the dropdown next to the price input
2. The currency symbol will update automatically based on your selection
3. The price will be displayed with the correct currency symbol throughout the application
4. Different currencies have appropriate formatting (e.g., JPY without decimal places, NOK with symbol after the amount)

### Docker Setup

To run the application in Docker:

1. Follow the instructions in the `DOCKER.md` file
2. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
3. Build and start the containers using the provided commands
4. Access the application at the specified URLs
5. Configure the environment variables as needed

## Suggested Tasks for Future Days

*Note: These are just ideas and not confirmed tasks.*

### Day 3 - User Experience Improvements

- Add confirmation modals for critical actions (delete user, change role)
- Implement pagination for users and items tables in the Admin Page
- Add sorting and filtering options for the tables
- Improve error handling with user-friendly messages

### Day 4 - Security Enhancements

- Implement role-based access control more thoroughly
- Add audit logging for admin actions
- Review and enhance password policies
- Add session timeout and refresh token functionality

### Day 5 - Feature Expansion

- Implement user profile management
- Add item image upload and management
- Create a dashboard with analytics and charts
- Implement notifications for important events (item sold, role changed)

### Day 6 - Testing and Documentation

- Write unit and integration tests for critical components
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Add user documentation for the admin interface
- Implement automated testing workflows

## Conclusion

Today we successfully fixed critical issues in the Admin Page related to user management and explored the database structure. The application now correctly handles user roles and deletion, preventing administrators from accidentally removing their own access. We also created a useful script for database exploration that will help with future debugging and development.
