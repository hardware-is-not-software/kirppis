# Day 2 - Admin Page Improvements and Database Exploration

## What We Did Today

### 1. Fixed User Management in Admin Page

We identified and fixed several issues in the Admin Page component related to user management:

- Fixed the comparison logic for disabling role change and delete buttons for the current user
- Added a helper function `isCurrentUser()` to check if a user in the table is the same as the currently logged-in user
- Updated the User interface to include the `_id` property to fix linter errors
- Added validation to check for valid user IDs before attempting to delete a user or change a user's role
- Added error handling to display a message when no user ID is provided
- Improved the delete button and role change handler to use either `user._id` or `user.id` as the user ID

### 2. Server Port Configuration

We addressed port conflict issues:

- Initially changed the server port from 5000 to 5001 to avoid conflicts
- Updated the client API configuration to match the new server port
- Updated the CORS configuration to include the new port
- Later reverted back to port 5000 based on requirements

### 3. Database Exploration

We created a script to explore the MongoDB database:

- Created a script at `server/src/scripts/db-query.ts` to query the database
- Discovered the structure of collections: categories, items, users, and tests
- Identified the user data structure and how IDs are stored in MongoDB

## How to Use What We Did

### Admin Page User Management

The Admin Page now correctly handles user management:

- Admins cannot change their own role or delete themselves
- The system properly identifies the current user using either ID or email
- Error handling prevents attempts to delete users with invalid IDs

### Database Query Script

To explore your MongoDB database:

1. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jonijantti/Documents/aiwork/kirppis && npx ts-node server/src/scripts/db-query.ts
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Connect to your MongoDB database
   - List all collections
   - Show sample documents from each collection
   - Display the total count of documents in each collection

This script is useful for debugging and understanding the current state of your database.

## Suggested Tasks for Future Days

*Note: These are just ideas and not confirmed tasks.*

### Day 3 - User Experience Improvements

- Add confirmation modals for critical actions (delete user, change role)
- Implement pagination for users and items tables in the Admin Page
- Add sorting and filtering options for the tables
- Improve error handling with user-friendly messages

### Day 4 - Security Enhancements

- Implement role-based access control more thoroughly
- Add audit logging for admin actions
- Review and enhance password policies
- Add session timeout and refresh token functionality

### Day 5 - Feature Expansion

- Implement user profile management
- Add item image upload and management
- Create a dashboard with analytics and charts
- Implement notifications for important events (item sold, role changed)

### Day 6 - Testing and Documentation

- Write unit and integration tests for critical components
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Add user documentation for the admin interface
- Implement automated testing workflows

## Conclusion

Today we successfully fixed critical issues in the Admin Page related to user management and explored the database structure. The application now correctly handles user roles and deletion, preventing administrators from accidentally removing their own access. We also created a useful script for database exploration that will help with future debugging and development.
